# Background

I am a highschool student who is looking to pursue Computer Science. Programming is all about problem solving, something I absolutely love doing. However, I was not able to constantly get myself to focus on my programming skills. I told myself I "didn't have the time". However, as it turns out I did have the time.

# Inspiration

The main inspiration behind this project was the desire to learn. I recently read in a book that the opposite of happiness is not sadness: it is, in fact, boredom. So we can sort of say that the primary force behind me writing these was the desire to learn and try something new. 

# How I went about it

Before I dipped my toes into Python back again, I decided to learn Git and I thank myself everyday I did. I highly recommend you to checkout the "Introduction to Git" path on Microsoft Learn [Add_Link], it really makes it easy to learn and is filled with practical applications of the theory taught. At the end of the module, I was left yearning for more so I decided to try the since-discontinued Github Labs [Recheck] (It has been replaced by Github Learn) and immediately fell in love with Github. From there, I decided to build upon 2-3 existing apps that I had coded earlier in Python. That's how this repository was born and I published my first ever Github release! 

My decision making process was very random, I just made anything that I thought was good enough to be converted to a Python program. I looked up anything that I didn't already know or needed help implementing and almost immediately found what I needed. How to properly search up error codes or how to properly frame questions is a must for every programmer.

# Where I go from here

Since I wrote this LEARN.md, I've actually fallen back to my old lazy behavior and so now I am looking once again to find something that will bring back the same old curiosity and creativity that I had when originally making this. As I said before, the main aim is learning something new!
